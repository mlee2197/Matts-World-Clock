# Matts-World-Clock

This project is aimed to help me practice HTML5 and CSS3 elements, animations, photoshop, and use of API.

The website allows the user to check the current time of a given location. By using the 'Open Weather Map' API, the user can also check the current weather of the respective location. The clock located at the top left of the screen utilizes the 'canvas' tag to draw the current time.

The project uses several languages includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. Photoshop was used to create the weather icons.
